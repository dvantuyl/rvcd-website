The record breaking heat wave that sparked summer here in Seattle couldn’t stop the dancers of Kouyaté Arts from lighting a blaze in the Rainier Valley Arts Center on Saturday, June 26th 2021. Rhythmic percussionists of West African tradition punctuated interludes between speakers -- their beats swelling to the dancers' joyful flight. The Audefua Day of Action event calls for the preservation of West African culture.
